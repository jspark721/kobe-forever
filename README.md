# Kobe Forever
### In Loving Memory of Kobe Bryant
##### August 23, 1978 - January 26, 2020

I know so many of us are so heartbroken by this tragic news of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna with 7 other passengers on that helicopter.

Itâ€™s really a strange feeling to know that a person you never met can make you feel so many emotions and break you down into tears. Yet so many of us are extremely heartbroken by this tragic news of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna along with 7 other passengers on that helicopter. May they all Rest In Peace. Sending psrayers to all the families of the lives lost.

I wanted to build and code something that pays tribute to the amazing life he has lead. Hope you guys enjoy.

### 24 | 8 Kobe Bryant, we love you and thank you.

###### Rest in Peace Kobe Bryant
